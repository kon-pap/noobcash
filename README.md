# Noobcash

Blockchain is the technology behind most of cryptocurrencies and is indeed a distributed database that allows users to make secure transcations between each other, without needing a central authority (e.g. bank).

Goal of this project is to create `Noobcash`, a simple blockchain system, where transactions between participants are recorded and consensus is ensured through Proof-of-Work.
